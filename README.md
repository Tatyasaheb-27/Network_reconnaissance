# Network_reconnaissance

ðŸ“Œ Objective

tatyadjkskdgsnhcvasfv

The goal is to perform a network reconnaissance scan using Nmap to identify open ports and understand potential security risks in a local network.

â¸»

ðŸ›  Tools Used

 â€¢ Nmap â€“ For scanning IP ranges and identifying open ports.
 
 â€¢ Wireshark (optional) â€“ For analyzing packets captured during scanning.

â¸»

ðŸš€ Steps Performed
 1. Installed Nmap from the official site.
    
 2. Identified local IP range using:

ipconfig   # (Windows)  
ifconfig   # (Linux/Mac)

 3. Ran a TCP SYN Scan on my local network:

nmap -sS 192.168.1.0/24

 4. Recorded IP addresses and open ports found.
 5. (Optional) Used Wireshark to capture and analyze packets.
 6. Researched the services running on detected ports and noted potential risks.

ðŸ“Š Sample Results
 â€¢ Example output of Nmap scan:

Nmap scan report for 192.168.1.1
PORT     STATE SERVICE
22/tcp   open  ssh
80/tcp   open  http
443/tcp  open  https


 â€¢ Risks identified:
 â€¢ Port 22 (SSH): If weak credentials are used, it may allow brute-force attacks.
 â€¢ Port 80 (HTTP): Unencrypted traffic can be intercepted.
 â€¢ Port 443 (HTTPS): Generally secure, but vulnerable if SSL/TLS is outdated.

ðŸ§© Key Learnings
 â€¢ Gained hands-on experience with TCP SYN scanning.
 â€¢ Understood how open ports reveal network exposure.
 â€¢ Learned how attackers can use port scanning as reconnaissance.
 â€¢ Explored how Wireshark complements Nmap by providing packet-level insights.
